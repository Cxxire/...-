To scrape the table from the website you mentioned (https://www.aastocks.com/tc/stocks/market/index/hk-index-con.aspx), you can use Python with the libraries `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`. Since you are using JupyterLab, you can run the following code in a notebook cell.

**Note:**  
- The table is dynamically generated with JavaScript, so `requests` alone may not get the table. For dynamic content, use `selenium` or `playwright` to render the page.
- Below is a solution using `selenium` (which works well in JupyterLab 3).

---

### 1. Install Required Packages

```python
!pip install selenium webdriver-manager beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

---

### 2. Scrape the Table

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import time

# Set up Selenium WebDriver
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run in headless mode (no browser UI)
options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)

# Open the webpage
url = "https://www.aastocks.com/tc/stocks/market/index/hk-index-con.aspx"
driver.get(url)
time.sleep(5)  # Wait for JS to render the table

# Get page source and parse with BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, "html.parser")
driver.quit()

# Find the table by id
table = soup.find("table", {"id": "tblTS2"})

# Parse table into DataFrame
df = pd.read_html(str(table))[0]
df.head()
```

---

### 3. Display or Save the Data

```python
# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

# Save to CSV if needed
df.to_csv("hk_index_table.csv", index=False)
```

---

**Tips:**
- If you want to extract more details (like links or images in the last column), you can further parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup.
- If you run into issues with ChromeDriver, make sure your Chrome browser is up to date.

Let me know if you want a version that extracts extra details (like the stock code links or chart images) or if you need a Playwright-based solution!
