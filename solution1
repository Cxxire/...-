No problem! You can use Selenium with Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) as well. Hereâ€™s how to do it in your Jupyter Lab environment:

---

## 1. Install Required Packages

In a Jupyter cell, run:
```python
!pip install selenium msedge-selenium-tools webdriver-manager
```

---

## 2. Download and Use Edge WebDriver

- Make sure your Edge browser is up to date.
- The script below uses `webdriver-manager` to automatically download the correct Edge WebDriver.

---

## 3. Selenium Script for Edge

```python
import os
import time
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.edge.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from webdriver_manager.microsoft import EdgeChromiumDriverManager

# Set download directory (change as needed)
download_dir = os.path.abspath("downloads")
os.makedirs(download_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Set Edge options for automatic download
edge_options = Options()
edge_options.use_chromium = True
edge_options.add_experimental_option("prefs", {
    "download.default_directory": download_dir,
    "download.prompt_for_download": False,
    "download.directory_upgrade": True,
    "safebrowsing.enabled": True
})
# edge_options.add_argument("--headless")  # Optional: run in headless mode

# Start Edge driver
driver = webdriver.Edge(EdgeChromiumDriverManager().install(), options=edge_options)

# Open the page
driver.get("https://www.aastocks.com/tc/stocks/market/index/hk-index-con.aspx")

# Wait for the page to load
time.sleep(3)

# Find and click the Excel download button
excel_button = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "ts2_icon_excel")
excel_button.click()

# Wait for download to complete (adjust time as needed)
time.sleep(5)

# List downloaded files
print("Downloaded files:", os.listdir(download_dir))

driver.quit()
```

---

## 4. Notes

- The downloaded Excel file will be in the `downloads` folder in your current working directory.
- If you have issues with headless mode and downloads, try running without `--headless`.
- You can process the Excel file with pandas after downloading.
